                <p>I need a website. As someone who is transitioning into a new career path,
                I need a platform to convey skills and projects that are outside of my work history and encompass more than just a blurb on a resume.
                However, most website builders are not free or not intuitive or both. I like having the flexibility to be creative that coding a custom website provides. 
                Coding a website also leverages my experience in engineering which fits well into my personal brand. </p>
