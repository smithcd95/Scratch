                <h1>Case Study #1</h1>
                <h3>Website Design</h3>
                <h2>TLDR:</h2>
                <p><b>Problem Statement:</b> Angelica is a recruiter who needs to efficiently see my skills because she has 500 applicants to review. <br> <br>
                    <b>Goal Statement:</b> Help recruiters who are rushed understand my skills and approach.  </p>
                <p>My design objective with the website is to concisely communicate my technique in a pleasing format. I am going for an <span class="highlight">elegant simplicity </span>. 
                    This will cater to the time constraint of myself (to <span class="highlight"> develop within 24 hrs</span>) and the end-user (<span class="highlight">busy recruiter</span>).
                    I chose a <span class="highlight">straightforward layout</span> combined with <span class="highlight">minimalistic design elements</span> to convey this. 
                    I then use Google's <span class="highlight">Robo Mono font</span> and <span class="highlight">black/white color schemes</span> as an homage to my <span class="highlight">technical background</span>. 
                    Further more, this allows me to then use <span class="highlight">color</span> in impactful ways to summarize information. 
                </p>

                <h2>Design Approach</h2>
                <p>My goal for this project is to design and develop the website within 24 hours. One thing I have learned is to focus on doing the simple things well before focusing on anything else.
                    I think this strategy will help to focus my efforts as well as align with the end-user (busy recruiter). If the end-user is short on time, 
                    putting myself in that position will help me design for them. <br>

                 </p>
                <p>I know I wanted something straighforward and simple. I went with a classic portfolio layout so that it would immediately be recognizable and comfortable to a user. 
                    This includes a headshot on the left with my name prominently displayed, my title, and a quick summary. I then added a small menu bar to the top right. Simple enough. 
                    Users should be able to enter here and immdeiately feel they know where they are and how to get around.<br>
                    I then wanted my projects listed below in two columns. In order to coax the user down the page, I decided to have the top of the project photos visible above the fold. 
                    This should convey scrollability and draw the user's attention downward. <br>
                    Finally, the user should land at the bottom in a small footer section. This area has a call to action and links to connect.
                </p>
                <p>
                    While implementing, I made some design changes. I added a box around my name which links to my linkedin (about me once that page is finished).
                     This communicates a clear way for users to get info about me if they are interested. 
                     The cursor typing animation and color swap on-hover add just enough interactivity for the user to be entertained.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Overall, I think the project was a success. Given more time I would like to focus on accesibility and mobile layout.
